Adds a paragraph block to Gutenberg called No Translation.

== Description ==

The No-Translation Gutenberg Block plugin adds a unique paragraph block to the Gutenberg editor, designed to be used in conjunction with translation plugins. 
It allows users to mark specific blocks of text to be excluded from automatic translations, ensuring that certain content remains in its original language across multilingual sites. 
This feature is particularly useful for preserving the integrity of technical terms, brand names, or any content that should not be altered by translation processes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `no-translation-gutenberg.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Exclude the class .no-translation from your translation plugins
4. Place No-Translation block into your posts
